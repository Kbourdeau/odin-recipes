    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For years, I’ve been searching for my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. I want outrageously delicious bakery-style chocolate chip cookies that completely capture my attention upon first bite. I want a chewy middle, barely crisp edges, complex flavor, and rich chocolate chips.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups chocolate chips*</li>
            <li>⅔ cup lightly packed coconut sugar or ½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup plus 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil**</li>
            <li>¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>Maldon flaky sea salt for sprinkling (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk to combine, then add the chocolate chips and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the coconut sugar, regular sugar, oil and water. Whisk until the sugar has incorporated into the oil and the mixture is smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, then stir just until combined and no more flour is visible (don’t overdo it).</li>
            <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Fill an ice cream scoop two-thirds with dough (or spoon the mixture into even 2-inch mounds), and place the dough onto one of the prepared sheets. Repeat with remaining dough, leaving several inches of space around each cookie.</li>
            <li>Freeze the cookies on their pans for 30 minutes, or chill them for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake until the edges are just starting to turn golden, about 14 to 17 minutes. Place the baking sheet on a cooling rack and sprinkle the cookies with flaky salt, if using. Repeat with the remaining cookies.</li>
        </ol>
